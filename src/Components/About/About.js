I am a regular blood donor, dedicated to helping those in need. In addition to problem-solving, I enjoy playing cricket, skating, and engaging in social work. My achievements include being awarded in the Code Samurai Hackathon 2022, a prestigious day-long programming competition organized by Dhaka University.
